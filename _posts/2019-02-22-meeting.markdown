Taken from DiscoverSUTD

Meeting to clarify objectives and concept of Discovery Week.
Concerns raise were:
1. We need to take note that it is Ramadan
2. Find ways to reach out to students that are disengaged

Presented this:
(images are overly large, to view the proper proposal please go [here](https://github.com/Fishbiscuit/Discovery-Week-Project-Site-Test/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2019-02-22-meeting.markdown))
# Concept
Adopting the model of a Conference with large-scale talks targeted at the general audience but also breakout sessions that participants can sign-up for on an individualised manner.

**Emphasis on personal agency to allow for self-discovery of SUTD's ecosystem.**

Inspiration:
1. [AWS Summit](https://aws.amazon.com/summits/singapore/), upcoming  [Agenda for April](https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/singapore/agenda/techfest/)
2. [Fintech festival](https://fintechfestival.sg/)

## Objectives
1. Freshmores - understand the spaces (virtual and physical), avenues for resources and communities in SUTD in order to embody the desired culture

**Culture embodying the spirit of innovation, collaboration, having self-initiated projects, self-directed learning and broad-based skill integration**

2. SUTD - celebrate the work done by our research community, 5th rows and housing (specifically amongst seniors)

**Showcase the potential of UROPs and taking up research projects in SUTD, similar to LCC in an interactive/ experiential manner**

# Planning Parameters
Discovery Week to **take place in the afternoons within the 1st week of term (i.e. 21 May to 24 May)?** Discover Week may tentatively begin from 2pm onwards however do avoid planning activities on Wednesday (22 May) afternoon and the timeslots for Tuesday as stated below.

Take note of Ramadan and be culturally sensitive

Have a focus on engaging students that are disengaged

Need to disseminate information clearly (especially academic matters) and resources/ opportunities

|Key Information|
|--|
|Considering the constraints here, the goal of this team would be to set up sufficient channels for freshmores to have a sustained engagement during **Term 1**.
Rather than relying on mass sessions, to allow them to have a conceptual idea of what might be interesting/important to them and go for it.|

# Team Composition

## Collaboration
- ensure consistent tone throughout all efforts
- fair representation of the community
- must ensure conceptual integrity throughout the events and update key documents that represent this

## Communications
1. Visual branding (guide, logos for events, copy)
2. Announcement channel (and it's management)
3. Calendaring

**Let's ask for a budget for this rather than having to rely on heavy student involvement considering that it's Week 7**

## Content
Overview of activities
- Housing Activities
- Pillar info
- Human libraries
- Lightning Talks
- Bands

# Proposed Activities
## ! Stakeholder buy-in list
1. Housing/HG/RLC for hostel access and booking of spaces
1. Calendar team that ROOT Communications is trying out

2. Pillar reps for introduction to pillar life
3. Bands for open-mic
4. Location for open-mic (eg. Mont Calzone/ Crooked Cooks)

## Establishing Conceptual Map
1. User Guide - Gitbook/Github Page/Wiki to explain the program
2. Demarcate events into 'Levels' based on level of technical difficulty
3. Static one-stop page to serve as event calendar
4. Working together with DSBJ app, pending their initial take-up rate and on evaluating their app's roadmap to check for alignment
5. Using [OpenSUTD](https://opensutd.github.io/OpenSUTD-static-design/) as the go-to conduit into SUTD life
    - Fifth Row Guides
    - Communication channels for queries
    - Knowledge/skills
    - Contribution guides

## Theory of Change
![Key framework driving our theory of change](https://i.imgur.com/qULvsIt.png)
Taken from [A novel approach to onboarding](https://blog.hiri.com/a-novel-approach-to-onboarding-4a6c952a3e62)

|**IF**|**THEN**|
|---|---|
|We define our desired **culture** clearly and it's exhibited **behaviours**| A natural **transition** into university life may occur smoothly|
|Freshmores are introduced to **existing communities** or given the opportunity to start their own. Every Freshmore is **inducted into the people on their floors** and shown how the **spaces in Housing** may be used|The **gap** between freshmores and seniors may be better breached|
|Freshmores are prepared for upcoming projects with **tools, resources, meetups** to get inspiration from. This may result in a **guided project** that culminates in an actual product within the stipulated time|Freshmores will be able to **uncover their personal interests earlier** in the university journey|
|Freshmores need to be shown the **realities of working in SUTD** and have their expectations tempered to realistic levels and the urgency of taking on a project early|We will be able to **identify talented freshmores** to carry on key initiatives and culture-building exercises|
|Emphasise the **potential of projects** as a catalyst for growth|We will be able to **map the state of SUTD** on a yearly basis|


## Stakeholder Map

1. Design-centric education focusing on human-centred solutions
2. Multi-discplinary curriculum to nurture future-ready graduates
3. Active, self-directed, collaborative and hands-on learning
4. Start-up atmosphere brimming with community spirit

# Review
## Discovery Week 2018
![Discovery Week Timetable](https://i.imgur.com/ZNAXU9t.jpg)
 - Students lost interest quite quickly as they had no mental compass as to what events would be useful
 - better aesthetic language would be desired
 - students are looking for something to transition them into university life to help them cope with Freshmore term
 - 13 events spread over two days starting from 0930 and ending at 1630

## Other University orientation efforts:
1. USP academic camp - introduce to incoming scholars the culture expected in the programme
1. Renaissance engineering programme camp - they undergo a guided project during the camp that is meant to be hands-on

## Organisation employee orientation efforts:
1. Public Service Foundation Course (https://www.cscollege.gov.sg/programmes/pages/display%20programme.aspx?epid=vae3uj66l29irohmc3tpgfolam)
1. Valveâ€™s employee handbook (https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf)
