# What is this?
**serve.sg** is an <span style="color:green;">open-source</span> <span style="color:blue;">skilled</span> volunteer <span style="color:red;">matching</span> platform, designed and driven entirely by volunteers, for volunteers.

**serve.sg** aims to connect skilled volunteers with charities or non-profit organisations (NPOs) in Singapore [<span style="color:red;">matching</span>]. The focus is on projects involving higher-level skills [<span style="color:blue;">skilled</span>], in order to empower charities and NPOs to improve their service delivery or organisational capabilities. Designed and driven entirely by volunteers, for volunteers, the open-development process [<span style="color:green;">open-source</span>] also allows volunteers as well as the charities and non-profit organisations to shape and to expand the platform based on their needs.

This is why we are making sure that our project documents are kept open so that **you** can be a part of this process.

# Unique Value Proposition

## Open-source
The open-development process means that serve.sg will evolve - following the initial development - as per the needs of the volunteers, charities, and non-profit organisations.

## Matching (and proposing)
Unlike existing platforms which only allow charities or NPOs to host projects, serve.sg allows volunteers to also pitch good ideas instead of merely accepting existing projects. Reciprocity and collaboration are key themes. A channel for “solutions to look for problems” is therefore created because sometimes charities or NPOs may not know all the possibilities or their potential until they see good ideas.

- **Team-based collaboration**: Volunteers can also work in teams, so that first-time volunteers can learn from veterans, thereby facilitating skills diffusion and social learning.
- **Synergy with service-learning programmes**: Not only is the ability to pitch projects to charities or NPOs complementary to service-learning undertakings in school, it is part of different features to attract students and schools en masse.
- **Post-project feedback**: Volunteers and charities or NPOs, at the end of each project, can rate one another.
- **Gamification**: Moving ahead, gamification would also encourage volunteers to put in quality work and to incentivise charities or NPOs to be good hosts.

## Skilled volunteerism
Volunteers can conceptualise innovative solutions and pitch ideas, and there are no limits on the relevance of skill sets.
